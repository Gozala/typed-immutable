# New maintainer is needed

Currently project no longer has a maintainer, this unfortunately means no one is going to help you resolve this issue, util new leader emerges.

If you think you can take on the ownership of this project please respond to [#21](https://github.com/Gozala/typed-immutable/issues/21)
