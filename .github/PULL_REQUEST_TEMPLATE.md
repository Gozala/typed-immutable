# New maintainer is needed

Currently project no longer has a maintainer, this unfortunately means no one is going to review this pull request util new leader emerges.
On the other hand you might be a good candidate to become a new leader, if that's appaling please respond to [#21](https://github.com/Gozala/typed-immutable/issues/21)
